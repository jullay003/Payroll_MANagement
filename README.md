# Payroll_MANagement

Payroll management system project in C++ is a desktop application that was created as a substantial, intricate, and efficient programme. The project contains numerous classes and subclasses, each of which contains a wide range of characteristics. The basic file handling actions users can carry out through this software project include adding new employee records, editing employee records, deleting records, and showing one or all employees' records. In addition to these, payroll administration gives customers the option to print a specific employee's pay stub.

Features:
1. Addition of New Employee: This function is available under the class employee's general group. Employee code number, name, location, phone number, joining date (day, month, and year), position, rating, and loan are among the details included in this feature. In addition to these, this function also saves information about the base pay of employees, housing benefits, and many other things.

2. Modify Employee Record: The user's employee ID is required for this method to operate in the C++ payroll management system project. The employee code number itself, joining date (day, month, and year), name, location, phone number, designation, grade, housing stipend, and loans provided to the employee are all subject to change. There are five grades for employees: A, B, C, D, and E.

3. Delete Employee Record: By providing the employee number, you can quickly erase an employee record from the Payroll Management System project. The user is prompted with a confirmation notification asking if they really want to remove the entry from the file.

4. Print Employee Salary Slip: This feature also requests the employee code, which is required to operate or activate a number of features in this C++ salary management system project. This function requests the user for the date, the employee's name, their title, and their rating before listing all the months of the year.
The user will also need to enter details like the employee's total number of hours worked over the course of the month and the number of days they worked during that month in order to print the pay sheet. The slip shows the employee's base pay, benefits, taxes, and total pay.

5. Display an Employee Record: By entering the employee ID number, users can view all the available data regarding a specific employee. The data for the visible employee record is what was entered when creating a new employee record.

6. Display Inventory of Employees: Unlike the previous feature, this one shows a list of all the workers who have been added to the file. The data are shown in a tabular style and include details like the employee's code name, phone number, date of hire, title, grade, and pay.
